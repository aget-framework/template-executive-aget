- `AGENTS.md` `@aget-version` updated to 3.17.0
- Inherits framework v3.17.0 deliverables: framework-manager archetype formalization (Q4=A.2 disposition); T2.18 SOP_scope_lock_ceremony LANDED v1.0.0; T2.19 AGET_SKILL_LIFECYCLE_SPEC LANDED v1.0.0 with full V-test authoring; T2.20 AGET_FLEET_UPGRADE_SPEC v0.1 DRAFT; T2.23 AGET_TASK_ROUTING_SPEC v0.1 DRAFT.

## [3.16.0] - 2026-05-02

**Theme**: Aligned with framework v3.16.0 (Framework-Discipline Closure + Wave-1A Spec Contracts + /aget-go Production)

### Changed

- Version bump: 3.15.0 → 3.16.0 (framework alignment)
- `AGENTS.md` `@aget-version` updated to 3.16.0
- **Universal-skills migration (#1120)**: 15 missing universal skills added from worker baseline (advisor/analyst/architect/consultant/developer/executive/operator/researcher/reviewer/spec-engineer pre-bump count 19 → post-migration 34, then post-archetype-fit-revert 31 = 29 universal + 2 archetype-specific).
- **Release-triad revert (CAP-TPL-016-07 NEW)**: 3 release-triad skills (`aget-release-build`, `aget-release-audit-specs`, `aget-release-critique`) removed from this template — moved to release-execution archetype catalog (worker, supervisor only). Closes the "presence-not-fit" misfit surfaced by Gate 1 defects audit.

### Compatibility

- **No breaking changes** in v3.16. Existing instances upgrade by version-bump only.
- Optional adoption: `**Plan_Status**:` / `**Gate_Status:**` schema in new PROJECT_PLAN files (CAP-PP-003 disambiguation; backward-compatible).
